### Why Your Business Should Rethink Acquisition vs Retention

In my recent [case study on customer segmentation using RFM analysis](/case-studies/rfm-customer-segmentation/), I explored the fictional 'thelook_ecommerce' dataset from BigQuery Public Data to uncover critical insights into customer behavior patterns. After assessing and thoroughly cleaning the data, I applied the classic RFM framework, analyzing customers based on how recently they purchased, how frequently they bought, and their monetary value.

But beyond basic segmentation, this analysis uncovered an important strategic insight: the business‚Äôs current heavy investment in acquiring new customers might be overshadowing significant opportunities in customer retention. By identifying distinct segments like repeat champions, emerging repeat buyers, and one-time shoppers, it became clear that focusing resources on nurturing existing relationships‚Äîespecially encouraging one-time shoppers to return‚Äîcould drive stronger, more sustainable growth.

The visualizations included in the case study further illustrate these findings, helping to clearly communicate customer behaviors and highlight opportunities for strategic action. A Sankey diagram illustrating new customer flows shown below.

The study was a challenging opportuniy to apply my new learnings from the Google Data Analytics Certification (and then some), and on top of that I learned desktop publishing to host this blog/portfolio to showcase the results, as well as utilizing GitHub to sync files across desktop and cloud applications while using R Studio. I also got a lot of first-hand experience with the power and limitations of utilizing AI (GPT and Notebook LM) to assist with building, editing and troubleshooting code. It has been quite the learning journey, and I look forward to continuing to post more case studies as I continue learning SQL and R and exploring other aspects of data analytics for business.

I'm actively exploring and learning about marketing analytics methodologies. If you have insights, questions, or feedback on the methodology I've used, I'd love to connect. Feel free to reach out or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremylutat/). üë•
