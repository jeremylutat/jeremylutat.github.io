As I transition from a product development background into data-driven brand strategy, I’ve been building a portfolio of analytics work — including segmentation analysis and seasonal tracking projects.

Here are three insights I’ve taken from this process so far:

---

### 1. SQL Is About Logic, Not Memorization

Early on, I thought SQL was about remembering commands. But it’s really about logical thinking. Once you understand `JOIN`s, filtering with `WHERE`, and aggregation with `GROUP BY`, everything starts to click. Tools like BigQuery made it easy to explore large datasets like TheLook and Iowa Liquor Sales.

### 2. Tableau Forces You to Tell a Story

Building dashboards in Tableau taught me that visual design matters. A chart that’s “correct” but confusing is still a failure. Thinking about how someone will use and interpret a dashboard shifted how I frame insights — especially when testing segmentation hypotheses.

### 3. Good Analysis Leads to Better Questions

The best part of building these projects wasn’t finding answers — it was uncovering better questions. Why do certain segments underperform? When do seasonal spikes start? These are the kinds of questions that move strategy forward, and they’ve reshaped how I approach marketing and merchandising work.

I’ll continue sharing more insights as my case studies expand. If you're pivoting into data or curious about the connection between analytics and brand strategy, feel free to connect.
