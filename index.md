# Welcome â€” Iâ€™m Jeremy Lutat  
**Product strategist, brand builder, and analytical problem solver**

Iâ€™ve spent over a decade driving product development, sourcing, and merchandising strategy across mass retail and licensed goodsâ€”most notably at Walmart and in leadership roles at key home brands. My work has always been rooted in strong process management, cross-functional leadership, and a deep understanding of how to build product stories that resonate with customers.

Now, Iâ€™m layering on technical data capabilitiesâ€”SQL, Tableau, R, and BigQueryâ€”to expand what I can bring to the table. With an Executive MBA and Google Data Analytics certification under my belt, Iâ€™m focused on using data to unlock smarter brand decisions and customer-led growth.

This portfolio highlights that transition: from product execution to insight-led strategy. Youâ€™ll find case studies that explore ecommerce trends, customer segmentation, and retail behaviorâ€”each combining strategic thinking with hands-on analytics.
