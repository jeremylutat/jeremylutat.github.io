Welcome! I’m Jeremy Lutat — a strategic problem solver with a background in product development and sourcing, now pivoting toward the analytical and customer-facing side of brand and marketing strategy.

This portfolio houses case studies from data analytics coursework, hands-on projects using tools like SQL and Tableau, and brand strategy examples built on years of retail experience.

Stay tuned as I continue expanding into marketing analytics, customer insight work, and decision science.
